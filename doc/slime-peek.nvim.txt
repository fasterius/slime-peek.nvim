 1. INTRODUCTION      				    *slime-peek.introduction*

 The aim of this plugin is to add convenience functions for data exploration
 tasks when using `vim-slime` with Python and R, such as quickly peeking at
 the head or column names of a data frame.

 The plugin will automatically detect which of the supported languages are
 currently in use in your document, whether that be Python or R scripts, R
 Markdown or Quarto documents.

 For scripts and R Markdown documents, the language is inferred by the file
 type, as those documents are only used with their respective programming
 language.

 For Quarto documents, `slime-peek` will check the current code chunk's
 language by default, with an option to instead use the language specified in
 the YAML header of the document (using either `engine:`, `knitr:` or
 `jupyter:`).

 2. USAGE      						   *slime-peek.usage*

 This plugin does not export any key mappings, but supplies user-commands
 (this section) or Lua functions (section 4) for its functionality:

 :PeekHead    			                       *slime-peek.PeekHead*

   This command prints the head of the word currently under the cursor in
   whatever REPL is configured with the `vim-slime` plugin.

   If you want to create a key map for this command, you can do something like
   the following:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>h', ':PeekHead<CR>')
<
 :PeekTail    		 	                       *slime-peek.PeekTail*

   This command prints the tail of the word currently under the cursor in
   whatever REPL is configured with the `vim-slime` plugin.

   If you want to create a key map for this command, you can do something like
   the following:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>T', ':PeekTail<CR>')
<
 :PeekNames                                           *slime-peek.PeekNames*

   This command prints the column names of the word currently under the cursor
   in whatever REPL is configured with the `vim-slime` plugin.

   If you want to create a key map for this command, you can do something like
   the following:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>n', ':PeekNames<CR>')
<
 :PeekDims                                             *slime-peek.PeekDims*

   This command prints the dimensions of the word currently under the cursor
   in whatever REPL is configured with the `vim-slime` plugin.

   If you want to create a key map for this command, you can do something like
   the following:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>d', ':PeekDims<CR>')
<
 :PeekTypes                                           *slime-peek.PeekTypes*

   This command prints the data types or classes of the columns of the word
   currently under the cursor in whatever REPL is configured with the
   `vim-slime` plugin.

   If you want to create a key map for this command, you can do something like
   the following:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>t', ':PeekTypes<CR>')
<
 :PeekHelp                                             *slime-peek.PeekHelp*

   This command prints the help pages for the word currently under the cursor
   in whatever REPL is configured with the `vim-slime` plugin.

   If you want to create a key map for this command, you can do something like
   the following:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>H', ':PeekHelp<CR>')
<
   The output of this may be paginated depending on your terminal settings, so
   you might also need to either move to the REPL and press `q` to exit the
   pagination or create an additional keymap to send `q` to the REPL.

==============================================================================

 1. CONFIGURATION      				   *slime-peek.configuration*

 use_yaml_language (default: `false`)           *slime-peek.use_yaml_language*

   Uses the Quarto YAML header for language detection instead of using the
   current code chunk's language. This is useful if you want to specify Quarto
   languages in a document-wide manner, rather than per code chunk.

 4. FUNCTIONS 					       *slime-peek.functions*

 peek_head()                                          *slime-peek.peek_head*

   This is the plugin function that `PeekHead` calls to print the head of the
   word under the cursor. You can also use this in a keymap:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>h', require('slime-peek').peek_head())
<
 peek_tail()                                          *slime-peek.peek_tail*

   This is the plugin function that `PeekTail` calls to print the tail of the
   word under the cursor. You can also use this in a keymap:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>T', require('slime-peek').peek_tail())
<
 peek_names()                                        *slime-peek.peek_names*

   This is the plugin function that `PeekNames` calls to print the column
   names of the word under the cursor. You can also use this in a keymap:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>n', require('slime-peek').peek_names())
<
 peek_dims()                                          *slime-peek.peek_dims*

   This is the plugin function that `PeekDims` calls to print the
   dimensions of the word under the cursor. You can also use this in a keymap:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>d', require('slime-peek').peek_dims())
<
 peek_types()                                        *slime-peek.peek_types*

   This is the plugin function that `PeekTypes` calls to print the data types
   or classes of the columns of the word under the cursor. You can also use
   this in a keymap:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>t', require('slime-peek').peek_types())
<
 peek_help()                                          *slime-peek.peek_help*

   This is the plugin function that `PeekHelp` calls to print the help pages
   of the word under the cursor. You can also use this in a keymap:
>lua
     vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>H', require('slime-peek').peek_help())
<
   The output of this may be paginated depending on your terminal settings, so
   you might also need to either move to the REPL and press `q` to exit the
   pagination or create an additional keymap to send `q` to the REPL.
